        <h1>Interviewing Neymar </h1>
       <p>
           During an interview about his lifetyle, Neymar said this: "You have to look at the things that I do on the pitch. Anything else is private," Neymar told reporters. "When I'm off the pitch, that's my private life. You have to judge me on the pitch. I have no problem talking about cards or sendings-off, but I have a private life. I'm 24 years old."
           He also added this: "I also like to go out and have fun with my friends. I have my family and friends. Why can I not go out and enjoy parties? I can do that and will continue to. If I'm aware of my duties the next day, I see no problem."
           This shows how just because he is famous he is not a human and he can't have fun, he can just pracice to be a better soccer player. 
           I bet this car in only one of the many he has.

        <h1>Neymar's House</h1>
                    <p>
                        I agree with what he said that that was his private life and reporters and no one really should care about what he does when his not playing. that's none of their business and I know they just like to bug him because he is famous and very rich. Supposedly he has many houses and cars. I mean, if I had the money that he has i would do the exact same thing he does: he goes to parties, buys things for him. I would do all that but i would also travel more. This is Neymar's house in Barcelona
                    </p>
